This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to loose comparison (==) when handling null or undefined values. The `bug.js` file contains a function with a flawed null check, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version using strict equality (===).  The loose comparison causes unexpected behavior when dealing with NaN values.  The README provides a detailed explanation of the issue and the solution.
